    "# Introduction\n",

    "We analytically calculate the local volume obtained through the random projection method, given boundaries defined by $x, \\frac{a \\pm w}{x}$ for a point located at $ab, a/b$ for $a > w > 0, b > 0$. This is a toy model that represents scale invariance in a multi-layer neural network.\n",

    "## Local Volume Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume estimated via random projections from a point $P = (ab, a/b)$ is the volume of the set reachable by straight lines from $P$. We're interested in the set bounded by $x, \\frac{a \\pm w}{x}$. The random projection approach amounts to finding $r(\\theta)$, where $r(\\theta)$ is the minimum positive distance such that\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where n is the dimension of the problem, and $V_{ball, n}$ is the volume of the unit ball in n dimensions. Due to the radial integrals, this volume is difficult to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, since the volume from random projections is equal to the volume of the set reachable by straight lines, we compute this volume directly by obtaining the bounding equations for this set and integrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symmetries\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the volume of any point inside the boundaries is identical under flips along the $x, y$  axes (where the point and boundaries are flipped, corresponding to the sign of the minima defining parameter $a$ and scaling parameter $b$. Therefore, without loss of generality we can calculate the volume asuming $a, b > 0$, working entirely in the first quadrant. \n",
    "\n",
    "## a > w\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is qualitatively different for $a < w$, as the boundaries of the set are no longer defined by inspecting a pair of lines in $x, y > 0$, but instead extra lines in the other quadrants with more unique boundary conditions. For now, we consider $a > w$. "

    "Without loss of generality (due to our symmetries), the boundary is primarily dominated by the lower boundary $\\left(x, \\frac{a - w}{x} \\right)$. This changes when a straight line from the point intersects instead with the top boundary. When this occurs, two things happen:\n",

    "- The line from $x_{c}$ to the original point ontop of touching the upper boundary, also touches the lower boundary at some $x_{i}$ or $x_{f}$, which represents the smallest or largest $x$ in the set. These values are also the largest or smallest possible values of $x$ for which a point drawn from them to the original point crosses the upper boundary, and crosses so exactly once.\n",

    "- For $x_{c, 2} > x > x_{c, 1}$, the set is given by the upper boundary $(x, \\frac{a + w}{x})$. $x_{c, 2}$ is a critical point similar to $x_{c, 1}$, but for the larger x values.\n",
