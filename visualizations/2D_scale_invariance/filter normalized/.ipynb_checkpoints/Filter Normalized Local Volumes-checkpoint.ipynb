    "Recall that our point was originally $(\\sqrt{a}b, \\sqrt{a}/b)$. We shoot out random vectors $\\vec{r}$ and track when they reach the boundaries. The effect of filter normalization is that the vector r is transformed from the original $\\vec{r} = v_x, v_y$ to $\\vec{r}_{norm} = v_x \\times \\sqrt{a}b, v_y \\times \\sqrt{a}/b$.\n",

    "In fact, it seems like the filter normalization actually makes our star convexity problem worse. But this may be an artifact of the system we study (where the total normal of the weights has such a huge impact). \n",
